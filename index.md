## About SAND

The SAND project coordinates network monitoring and diagnostics from over a hundred application-level
measurement points and aggregates them into a measurement archive.  This curated measurement archive
provides access to historical and quasi-real-time network performance data, allowing for higher-level
diagnastics and analyses.

SAND supports and collaborates with long-running activities such as the
[OSG-Networking area](https://opensciencegrid.org/networking/) and the
[WLCG Throughput working group](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LCG/NetworkTransferMetrics).  The
data collected by each of these projects goes into the SAND Network Monitoring Archive (SAND-NMA).

SAND maintains a map of CC\* sites running perfSONAR; to allow your site to show up, [follow these directions](join-community).

## SAND Network Monitoring Archive

The SAND-NMA aims to aggregate as much network monitoring tests results as feasible, providing a
knowledgebase for debugging networks and performing data analytics.  This archive consists of
a data collector (polling measurement endpoints), a message bus (which endpoints can also push
data into directly), an archive, and a visualization platform, as pictured here:

Currently, we are recording network measurements from perfSONAR and
[HTCondor file transfer](https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/other/schedd-filebeats/); we plan to
extend this to XRootD services during 2020.

A few metrics about our service:

* SAND users: Engaged BNL (ATLAS), AGLT2 (ATLAS), MWT2 (ATLAS), UCSD (CMS), Nebraska (CMS), Wisconsin (CMS), MIT (CMS), and Purdue (CMS), all within the last year, to identify and resolve network issues
* Number of data sources: 236 distinct perfSONAR endpoints
* Number of HTCondor submit hosts reporting network measurements: 19
* Number of distinct measurements in the ElasticSearch database: over 10 billion, from February 28, 2018 to present
